# Intermediate SQL Test Project

For this project we will use a SQLite database called chinook.db, which contains information about a fictional digital music shop.

The goal is to answer some business questions. For example, selecting 3 albums from a list of 4 to add to the store based on the information available in the database related to the artists that own those albums.

The database structure was added as an image.
