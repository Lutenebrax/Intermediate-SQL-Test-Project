# Intermediate SQL Test Project

For this project we will use a SQLite database called chinook.db, which contains information about a fictional digital music shop.

The goal is to answer some business questions. For example, selecting 3 albums from a list of 4 to add to the store based on the information available in the database related to the artists that own those albums.

The database structure was added as an image.

Also, an unmodified database was added just in case.
